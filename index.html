    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm Jacob You, a software engineer at Duke University studying Computer Science and Statistics. 
        I've been studying CS ever since middle school and am comfortable coding in Python, Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, R, and MIPS.
        I'm particularly interested in AI and its uses, with research on sentiment analysis and multi-agent learning. <br>
